    <h2>If you're a coffee lover, you <em>have</em> to try these...</h2>
    <p>
        Coffee-flavored, this cookie is great for caffeine addicts like myself who love the taste of coffee but want a bit more sugar and don't want it in the form of 2 extra packets. Mixed with chocolate, this cookie comes as a great treat!

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 Large Egg</li>
        <li>5 Tbsp. Unsalted Butter at Room Temperature</li>

    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Begin this recipe by preheating the oven to 350 degrees F. and line a large baking sheet with parchment paper. In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, baking soda, salt, and set aside.</li>
        <li>In a small bowl, stir together the instant espresso powder and warm water until the instant espresso has completely dissolved.</li>
        <li>Using a stand mixer or hand mixer on low speed, mix together the sugar, butter, egg, and vanilla extract until fully combined. Add in the coffee mixture and the flour mixture and mix to combine, careful not to over mix.</li>            <li>Beat in eggs and vanilla until fluffy.</li>
        <li>Turn the mixture off and gently fold in the chocolate and spoon the cookie dough onto the prepared cookie sheet, in 1 heaping tablespoon of cookie dough, spaced at least an inch apart.</li>
        <li>Place into the oven and allow the cookies to bake 10 to 12 minutes, until the edges are set and the cookies are soft and puffy.</li>
        <li>Remove the cookies from the oven and allow them to cool for 5 minutes on the cookie sheet before removing. Serve the cookies warm or once they have cooled completely.</li>
        <li>Store the cookies in an airtight container at room temperature up to 5 days.</li>
    </ol>
