    <h2>Oatmeal rasin cookies come as a close second to chocolate chip, but provide as a slightly healthier alternative.</h2>
    <p>
        An oatmeal raisin cookie is a type of drop cookie made from an oatmeal-based dough with raisins. Its ingredients also typically include flour, sugar, eggs, salt, and spices. A descendant of the Scottish oatcake, the oatmeal raisin cookie has become one of the most popular cookies in the United States.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 Large Eggs</li>
        <li>1 Cup Unsalted Butter, Softened to Room Temperature</li>
        <li>1/4 Cup Granulated White Sugar</li>
        <li>1 Cup Packed Light or Dark Brown Sugar</li>
        <li>1 and 1/2 Cups All-Purpose Flour</li>
        <li>1/2 Tsp Sea Salt</li>
        <li>3 Cups Old-Fashioned Whole Rolled Oats</li>
        <li>1 Tbsp Pure Vanilla Extract</li>
        <li>1 Tsp Baking Soda</li>
        <li>1 Cup Rasins</li>
        <li>1 Tbsp Molasses</li>
        <li>Optional: 1/2 Chopped Toasted Wallnuts</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Using a hand mixer or a stand mixer fitted with paddle attachment, cream the softened butter and both sugars together on medium speed until smooth, about 2 minutes. Add the eggs and mix on high until combined, about 1 minute. Scrape down the sides and bottom of the bowl as needed. Add the vanilla and molasses and mix on high until combined. Set aside.</li>
        <li>In a separate bowl, whisk the flour, baking soda, cinnamon, and salt together. Add to the wet ingredients and mix on low until combined. Beat in the oats, raisins, and walnuts (if using) on low speed. Dough will be thick, yet very sticky. Chill the dough for 30-60 minutes in the refrigerator (do the full hour if you’re afraid of the cookies spreading too much). If chilling for longer (up to 2 days), allow to sit at room temperature for at least 30 minutes before rolling and baking.</li>
        <li>Preheat oven to 350°F (177°C). Line two large baking sheets with parchment paper or silicone baking mats. Set aside.</li>
        <li>Roll balls of dough (about 2 tablespoons of dough per cookie) and place 2 inches apart on the baking sheets. I recommend using a cookie scoop since the dough can be sticky. Bake for 12-14 minutes until lightly browned on the sides. The centers will look very soft and under-baked. Remove from the oven and let cool on baking sheet for 5 minutes before transferring to a wire rack to cool completely. The cookies will continue to “set” on the baking sheet during this time.</li>
    </ol>
