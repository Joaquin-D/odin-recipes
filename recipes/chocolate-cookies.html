    <h2>Chocolate chip cookies are some of my <strong>favorite</strong> cookies <em>of all time!</em></h2>
    <p>
        A chocolate chip cookie is a drop cookie that features chocolate chips or chocolate morsels as its distinguishing ingredient. Chocolate chip cookies originated in the United States around 1938, when Ruth Graves Wakefield chopped up a Nestl√© semi-sweet chocolate bar and added the chopped chocolate to a cookie recipe.
